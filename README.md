# Nova

It's gonna start as a language, but trust the process - **shit gonna be lit ;)**

## Purpose

Nova will be a robust language that allows developers and indie developers alike to briefly and feasibly piece together API logic. From simulating API workflows, to live APIs, **Nova** will enable a intuitive way on finalizing a solid and secure API workflow.

Think FastAPI on steroids with explicit control over HTTP headers, body, and request handling.
